# Quick-IPv4-Changer

A simple PowerShell script to change the IPv4 address of a network adapter fast.

## Description
Quick-IPv4-Changer allows users to quickly change the IPv4 address of a network adapter through a PowerShell script. This lightweight tool is easy to use, minimizing the time spent in networking configuration.

## Features
- Change IPv4 address of a network adapter easily.
- No installation required; only need to run the PowerShell script.
- Simple prompt for quick selection or the ability to pass the parameters instead for use in shortcuts or other scripts.

## Usage
1. Download the `Quick_IPv4_Changer.ps1` script from the GitHub repository.
2. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
3. Navigate to the directory where the downloaded script is located.
4. Execute the script using the following command: `.\Quick_IPv4_Changer.ps1`
5. Follow the prompts to select the network adapter and specify the new IPv4 address.
  - Instead of using the prompt, all parameters can also be passed during the call.

I recommend using Automator on Mac or using shortcuts on Windows for recurring workflows.

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator privileges
